  <h1><center><b> Patrick Moorehead's Portfolio </b></center></h1>
  <p>My name is Patrick Moorehead and I am a interdisciplinary artist. I was born in Nagoya, Japan and have spent my life jumping between living in Japan and California. Throughout my art practice
  I try to incorporate as much of my time and experiences in Japan into my art as possible while also exploring new mediums to create. My interests are video games, animation, fantasy novels and creating things.</p>
  <p>My work leans more towards digital with many of the more recent projects I have made being in a digital medium. 
  Ever since I was young I was attached at the hands to a computer, and since then have been working and playing digitally. For my future work, I aim to go into the video game industry either as
  either a developer or designer.</p>
  <br></br>
  
  <h1><center><b> "Seeing Threes" </b></center></h1>
  <p>DSLR, Lightroom, 2018</p>
  <p>For this project, I was tasked with creating a constructed digital image under the theme of "creepy." In this image, I took three different images of myself around a table
  and digitally constructed me looking at me looking at me.

  <h1><center><b> "Glitch" </b></center></h1>
  <p>Photoshop, Notepad ++, 2019</p>
  <p>For this project, I was tasked with glitching an image by taking the text values within the image file and alter them to create a new image. For this, I input the phrase
  "BANANAS ARE BETTER" 200 times in the middle of the body of text, creating this image.</p>

  <br></br>
  <h1><center><b> "Turtle Sounds" </b></center></h1>
  <p>Photoshop, Audacity, Atom, 2019</p>
  <p>For this work I used the sound program Audacity to alter an image. I added multiple different effects available in Audacity, including the Echo, Wave, and Noise Cancellation effects to this image. </p>
  <center><img class="img-fluid" src="bootimages/turtle.jpg" style="max-width:90%;" alt="turtle"></center>

  <br></br>
  <h1><center><b> "Minecraft 3D Print" </b></center></h1>
  <p>Minecraft, Mineways, Ultimaker</p>
  <p>For this project, me and my classmates were told to create a 3D object in Minecraft and use the Mineways program to turn it into a 3D model from which we could print. I decided to make a tiny 
  coffee mug which I printed twice, the smaller being the original and the larger being the final.</p>

  <h1><center><b> "My First Snow in Kyoto" </b></center></h1>
  <p>Google Maps, HTML, 2019</p>
  <p>This work took me back home to where I previously lived before coming to SJSU, Kyoto, Japan. I wanted to recreate my first experience having snow fall while living there and also show the area
  where I lived. I took images I took while living there and added the function of being able to see the actual location on Google Maps while I was first learning about HTML.</p>

  <h1><center><b> "Meme" </b></center></h1>
  <p>Photoshop, Google Images, 2019</p>
  <p> For this work I was put into a group with two other people and tasked with trying to create a meme from other memes.

  <h1><center><b> "Eye See You" </b></center></h1>
  <p>After Effects, Photoshop, 2020</p>
  <p>This was my first attempt at motion tracking using After Effects where I took footage using my phone of a 3D printed monster to create a weird composition. The project
  makes use of the motion tracking feature in After Effects, as well as keylighting and lighting tools.</p>

  <h1><center><b> "Realities of Covid" </b></center></h1>
  <p>After Effects, Photoshop, Audacity, 2020</p>
  <p>In the middle of the Covid pandemic and quarantine, I wanted to make a digital piece that reflected the difficulties doctors face when dealing with patients who got Covid as a way to introduce myself
  to digital video editing. I took clips from popular documentaries and shorts from media and attempted to recreate a heart-wrenching propaganda piece we sometimes see today.</p>

  <h1><center><b> "Retro Saver" </b></center></h1>
  <p>Premiere Pro, Processing, Audacity, 2019</p>
  <p>My goal with this project was to recreate the old screen savers that were around in the early 2000s with the crazy art style and random effects. I attempted to do so using Processing,
  making a square spiraling around another square with rotating color effects. </p>

  <h1><center><b> "Space Force" </b></center></h1>
  <p>Unity, Piskel, 2020</p>
  <p>This is one of the most enjoyable projects I had the opportunity to work on. I got to work with another individual who created the art assets while I designed and worked on the
  game mechanics in Unity. It was a stressfully pleasant experience where I got to push myself and learn a form of digital media I had not previously done.</p>
