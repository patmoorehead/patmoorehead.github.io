<p style = "color: white;">My name is Patrick Moorehead and I am a interdisciplinary artist. I was born in Nagoya, Japan and have spent my life jumping between living in Japan and California. Throughout my art practice
  I try to incorporate as much of my time and experiences in Japan into my art as possible while also exploring new mediums to create. My interests are video games, animation, fantasy novels and creating things.</p>
  <p style = "color: white;">My work leans more towards digital with many of the more recent projects I have made being in a digital medium. 
  Ever since I was young I was attached at the hands to a computer, and since then have been working and playing digitally. For my future work, I aim to go into the video game industry either as
  either a developer or designer.</p>
